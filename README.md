This repository contains my assignment submission for the **Security Officer Trainee role at Accuknox**.

## 📌 Overview

I performed the vulnerability assessment using **two different approaches**:

1. **Linux Environment (Open-Source Tools)** → Tools like *Nmap, Nikto, OpenSSL, cURL*.
2. **Windows Environment (Nessus Vulnerability Scanner)**.

Both methods are documented and demonstrated separately for clarity.
